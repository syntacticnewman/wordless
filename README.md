# Wordless

A word guessing game inspired by [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

## About

Wordless is a game where you have six chances to guess a five-letter word in English.

## Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## API

This game uses a public API provided by Frontend Masters to get the word of the day and validate user guesses. The API is featured in the course [Complete Intro to Web Development, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v3/) taught by Brian Holt, which I highly recommend.
